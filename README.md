# Other possible ways to get things done
- Building a chrome app alone can make things done.
- The chrome app may be replaced by a local server and the [weibo-backup-crx](https://github.com/tiye/weibo-backup-crx) chrome extension with [sendNativeMessage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-sendNativeMessage) api.
I decided to build a chrome app because I happened to think of that. : (

# For debugging



# Built with
- [weibo-backup-crx](https://github.com/tiye/weibo-backup-crx)
